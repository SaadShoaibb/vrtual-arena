# Multilingual Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Basic Infrastructure**:
   - Added next-intl library for internationalization
   - Created translation files for English and French
   - Set up middleware for language detection and routing
   - Implemented locale-specific routes with [locale] directory
   - Added language toggle component in navigation

2. **Translation Files**:
   - Comprehensive translation files for English and French
   - Organized by sections: navigation, home, about, footer, etc.
   - Includes all user-facing text from main components

3. **Components Updated with Translations**:
   - HeroSection: All text now uses translations
   - About section: All text now uses translations
   - Footer: All text now uses translations
   - BookNowButton: Button text now uses translations

4. **SEO Improvements**:
   - Added proper hreflang tags for language variants
   - Language-specific metadata
   - Canonical URLs for each language version

5. **Language Detection**:
   - Automatic language detection based on browser settings
   - Language preference stored in cookies
   - Manual language selection via toggle

## Current Issues and Fixes Applied

1. **Import Path Issue**:
   - Fixed incorrect import path in LanguageToggle component
   - Changed from `next-intl/client` to `next/navigation`
   - Updated language switching logic to work with URL paths

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Created proper request.js file in src/i18n directory
   - Updated next.config.mjs to point to the correct configuration file

3. **Navigation Logic**:
   - Updated language toggle to handle path changes correctly
   - Improved routing for language switching

## What Still Needs to Be Done

1. **Component Translation**:
   - Continue updating remaining components to use translations
   - Use the find-missing-translations.js script to identify untranslated text

2. **Testing**:
   - Test language switching in all pages
   - Verify SEO tags are correctly implemented
   - Test automatic language detection

3. **Documentation**:
   - Complete MULTILINGUAL_README.md with usage instructions
   - Add comments to key files for better maintainability

4. **Additional Languages**:
   - If needed, add support for additional languages by following the same pattern

## How to Continue Implementation

1. Run the application and test the language toggle
2. Use the find-missing-translations.js script to identify untranslated text
3. Update additional components to use the translation system
4. Test all functionality in both English and French

## Best Practices to Follow

1. Always use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
2. Keep translation files organized by sections
3. Test all user flows in all supported languages
4. Ensure proper SEO metadata for each language version
